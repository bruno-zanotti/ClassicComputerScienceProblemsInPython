## Versioning and Packages

The source code in this repository requires Python 3.7 and installation of the [typing_extensions](https://github.com/python/typing/tree/master/typing_extensions) package. Due to its extensive use of Python 3.7 features (data classes, advanced type hints, etc.), most of the source code will not work with earlier versions of Python. You can install the `typing_extensions` package with `pip3 install typing_extensions` or `pip install typing_extensions` depending on your Python/pip setup.
